    "text": "Copernicus is the Earth Observation component of the European Union’s space programme (copernicus.eu). You will need to register for a Copernicus account in order to access the data and run this notebook.\nThis notebook will download and process the Copernicus Marine global ocean reanalysis data. The reanalysis is built to be as close as possible to the observations (i.e. realistic) and in agreement with the model physics. It covers the period from 1992 to 31/06/2021. The interim datasets cover 01/07/2021 to M-4 period. The dataset includes the sea_water_salinity, currents information from top to bottom and 2D sea surface level, bottom potential temperature, mixed layer thickness, and sea ice information. We are using the salinity, mixed layer thickness and bottom potential temperature from this dataset.\nWe will also download and process the Copernicus Global Ocean Gridded L 4 Sea Surface Heights. Altimeter satellite gridded Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year [1993, 2012] mean. The SLA is estimated by Optimal Interpolation, merging the L3 along-track measurement from the different altimeter missions available.

The latter two are used to compute speed and direction later. In addition, we will process the winds into 3 time periods of the day: 0-8 UTC, 9-16 UTC, and 17-24 UTC.

For cloud-hosted datasets (which is what this tutorial best works with), we choose to download granules to the local machine instead of streaming them to the working Python scripts as some users may not be physically available in the us-west region for streaming to be effective. Local downloading may result in heavy file sizes, but is consistent, and we am also providing some tweaks to save as much as you can, especially if your research interest area requires a long temporal range and does not cover globally.\n\n# Log in using .netrc file\nauth = earthaccess.login(strategy=\"netrc\")\n\nWe are already authenticated with NASA EDL",

    "text": "Download granules for an extended period of time\nSince you cannot slice data spatially, downloading granules is going to take up a lot of disk space if you only need data within a small bounding box. For our task, we wrote a simple function to slice data and wrote it into a new file.\nYou can consult the earthacess library website or their notebooks for code snippets on how to browse and look up collections. For this notebook, we mainly focus on the downloading aspect. First, we need to get the list of granules to download.\nSince earthacess does not support spatial slicing, we developed a method to download, slice, combine, and export data yearly, then finally delete temporary downloaded files to save disk space. Assumed that you already knew the temporal, spatial range of the dataset of your chosen, we first download the data by year into a temporary folder, then slice the data and then export the combined data to another folder.\n\n# Our approach\n# Month end not included\n\ndef download_and_combine_granules(short_name, month_start, month_end, lat1=5, lat2=25, lon1=60, lon2=80):\n    for month in pd.date_range(month_start, month_end, freq='M').strftime('%Y-%m-%d'):      \n        print('Collecting granules')\n        granules = earthaccess.granule_query().short_name(short_name).temporal(f'{month[:7]}-01',month).get(366)\n        \n        MAIN_FOLDER = 'demonstrated data/earth_data'\n        TEMP_FOLDER = 'temp'\n        path_temp_folder = os.path.join(MAIN_FOLDER, TEMP_FOLDER)\n        path_processed_folder = os.path.join(MAIN_FOLDER, short_name)\n        # create folder to store data\n        if not os.path.exists(path_temp_folder):\n            os.makedirs(path_temp_folder)\n        if not os.path.exists(path_processed_folder):\n            os.makedirs(path_processed_folder)\n        files = earthaccess.download(granules, path_temp_folder)\n       \n        \n        ## if dataset coordinates are slice-able, use:\n        print('Slicing...')\n        data = xr.open_mfdataset(f'{path_temp_folder}/*.nc').sel(lat=slice(lat1, lat2), lon=slice(lon1, lon2))\n    \n        \n        # combine files together \n        ## for some collections, coordinate names are 'lat' and 'lon' while their underlying indices are 'latitude' and 'longitude', respectively\n        ## may or may not be applicable for other datasets on the site.\n        ## get bounding box if not sliceable\n        ### lat1_idx, lat2_idx, lon1_idx, lon2_idx = get_bounding_box(os.path.join(path_temp_folder, first_file), lat1, lat2, lon1, lon2)\n        ### data = xr.open_mfdataset(f'{path_temp_folder}/*.nc').isel(latitude=slice(lat1_idx, lat2_idx+1), longitude=slice(lon1_idx, lon2_idx+1))\n        \n        data.to_netcdf(f'{path_processed_folder}/{month}.nc')\n        \n        # delete files in the temporary folder\n        print('Deleting temporary files...')\n        files = glob.glob(f'{path_temp_folder}/*.*')\n        for f in files:\n            os.remove(f)\n\ndef get_bounding_box(file_path, lat1=0, lat2=30, lon1=60, lon2=80):\n    \"\"\"\n    The dataset we experimented did not have indexed coordinates, \n    so we resorted to slicing using index positions\n    \"\"\"\n    ds = xr.open_dataset(file_path)\n    \n    lat_vals = ds.lat.values\n    lon_vals = ds.lon.values\n    \n    lat1_idx = np.abs(lat_vals-lat1).argmin()\n    lat2_idx = np.abs(lat_vals-lat2).argmin()\n    lon1_idx = np.abs(lon_vals-lon1).argmin()\n    lon2_idx = np.abs(lon_vals-lon1).argmin()\n    \n    return lat1_idx, lat2_idx, lon1_idx, lon2_idx\n\n\n# download and combine every month's worth of data\ndownload_and_combine_granules(short_name='MUR25-JPL-L4-GLOB-v04.2',\n                          month_start='2003-01', month_end='2003-03', \n                          lat1=5, lat2=25, lon1=60, lon2=80)\n\nCollecting granules\n Getting 31 granules, approx download size: 0.0 GB\nSlicing...\nDeleting temporary files...\nCollecting granules\n Getting 28 granules, approx download size: 0.0 GB\nSlicing...\nDeleting temporary files...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlist_of_missing_dates = [\"2003-01-04\", \"2003-01-18\", \"2003-02-18\"]\n\nfor date in list_of_missing_dates:\n    result = earthaccess.search_data(\n        short_name='MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1',\n        cloud_hosted=True,\n        bounding_box = (60, 5, 80, 25),\n        temporal=(date, date)\n    )\n    \n    MAIN_FOLDER = 'demonstrated data/earth_data'\n    TEMP_FOLDER = 'temp'\n    path_temp_folder = os.path.join(MAIN_FOLDER, TEMP_FOLDER)\n    file = earthaccess.download(result, path_temp_folder)\n\nGranules found: 1\n Getting 1 granules, approx download size: 0.0 GB\nError while downloading the file 20030218090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1.nc\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.9/site-packages/earthaccess/store.py\", line 488, in _download_file\n    r.raise_for_status()\n  File \"/srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests/models.py\", line 960, in raise_for_status\n    raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)\nrequests.exceptions.HTTPError: 502 Server Error: Bad Gateway for url: https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-protected/MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1/20030218090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1.nc",
